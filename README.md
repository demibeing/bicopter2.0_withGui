# bicopter2.0_withGui
Firmware and Gui for esp32 bicopter with a Gui app
this is a code to run esp32 controlled bicopter paired with PCA9685 servo driver,
flysky fs-i6 reciever and transmitter , MPU6050.
roll is controlled by servos and pitch is controlled via differential thrust.
the code is in early stages , currently i havent added the pitch stabilization or logic.
